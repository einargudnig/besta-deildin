# Player Stats Implementation

## Phase 1: API Integration and Data Models

### API Football Client Updates
- [ ] Review and update `getPlayerStatsFromMatch` method in `ApiFootballClient`
  - [ ] Add proper error handling
  - [ ] Add rate limiting consideration
  - [ ] Add retry mechanism for failed requests
- [ ] Create Zod schema for player stats API response
- [ ] Add validation for API response using Zod
- [ ] Add tests for API client methods

### Data Models
- [ ] Create PlayerStats interface/type
- [ ] Create Zod schema for PlayerStats
- [ ] Create database schema for player stats
  - [ ] Consider indexing strategy for performance
  - [ ] Add foreign key constraints to players table
- [ ] Create migration for new player stats table

## Phase 2: Stats Calculation Service

### Core Service Implementation
- [ ] Create PlayerStatsService class
- [ ] Implement methods for:
  - [ ] Fetching stats for a single match
  - [ ] Fetching stats for multiple matches
  - [ ] Calculating aggregate stats
  - [ ] Calculating performance metrics
- [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Add input validation using Zod schemas

### Stats Calculation Logic
- [ ] Define scoring rules for different stats
- [ ] Implement calculation methods for:
  - [ ] Goals scored
  - [ ] Assists
  - [ ] Clean sheets (for goalkeepers/defenders)
  - [ ] Cards (yellow/red)
  - [ ] Minutes played
  - [ ] Performance rating
- [ ] Add configuration for customizable scoring rules

## Phase 3: Database Integration

### Repository Layer
- [ ] Create PlayerStatsRepository
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations
- [ ] Add methods for:
  - [ ] Bulk insert/update stats
  - [ ] Querying stats by player
  - [ ] Querying stats by match
  - [ ] Querying aggregate stats
- [ ] Add transaction support for bulk operations

### Data Synchronization
- [ ] Create service for syncing match stats
- [ ] Implement retry mechanism for failed syncs
- [ ] Add logging for sync operations
- [ ] Add monitoring for sync status

## Phase 4: Testing

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test API client methods
- [ ] Test Zod schemas
- [ ] Test stats calculation logic
- [ ] Test repository methods
- [ ] Test service layer

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test API integration
- [ ] Test database operations
- [ ] Test full stats calculation flow
- [ ] Test error scenarios

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Test bulk operations
- [ ] Test query performance
- [ ] Test API rate limiting
- [ ] Test memory usage

## Phase 5: Documentation

- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Document data models
- [ ] Document calculation rules
- [ ] Add examples for common use cases
- [ ] Document error handling
- [ ] Add setup instructions

## Phase 6: Monitoring and Maintenance

- [ ] Add logging for critical operations
- [ ] Set up monitoring for:
  - [ ] API usage
  - [ ] Database performance
  - [ ] Sync operations
- [ ] Create maintenance scripts
- [ ] Add backup procedures

## Notes
- Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed stats
- Plan for handling missing or incomplete data
- Consider implementing a queue system for processing large batches of matches
- Plan for data validation and cleanup procedures
